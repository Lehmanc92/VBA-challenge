# VBA-challenge

Description:

This repository contains a VBA script I created to iterate through multiple tabs (years) of stock data and compile the yearly stock price change, percent change, and total volume for each company (as represented by a ticker symbol). The script also automatically displayes the companies with the greatest percent increase, percent decrease, greatest total volume, and their respective values.

The script compiles this information for each tab (years 2014-2016), and I have attached a Word Document with screenshots of the data summaries.

Thank you,
